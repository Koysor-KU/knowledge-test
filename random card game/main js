  /*
you have a set of four playing cards - a diamond, a spade, a heart, and a club. Now, you close your eyes and pick a card randomly. If it's not a spade, you put it back and pick again. You keep doing this until you finally pick the spade card. Each time you pick a card, you shout out loud what card it is.

The code you've mentioned is like a game that does the picking and shouting part automatically. It keeps picking a card randomly from the set until it picks the spade card. And as it picks each card, it shows you which one it picked.
